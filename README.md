**News Feed App**
This is a React Native application that fetches and displays news articles using the News API. It includes features like search, pagination, bookmarking, and liking articles.

**Features**
Fetches news articles from the News API
Displays a shimmer effect while loading articles
Supports infinite scrolling and pull-to-refresh
Allows users to search articles by title, author, or description
Users can like and bookmark articles
Handles offline mode with cached articles using AsyncStorage

**Note**
I did not use left or right gestures for liking and bookmarking. Instead, users can like an article by double-tapping it and bookmark an article by pressing the bookmark icon.
